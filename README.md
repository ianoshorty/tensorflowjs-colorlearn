# TensorflowJS Color Learning Experiment

This is my first "functional" machine learning experiment created from scratch (ie. not using tutorial material).

The goal was to be given a set of input colour "features" and generate the output "label" of the mixed colour.

In english, that means if I mix "red" and "yellow" I get a prediction of "green".

I'm open sourcing in case its useful for anyone else.

# Usage

1. `yarn`
2. `yarn start`
3. Visit `localhost:3000`
4. Wait till the `loss` value is less than `0.001`.
5. Play.
